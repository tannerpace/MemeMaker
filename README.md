# MemeMaker

This project was developed under the repository tannerpace/memegenerator. After having trouble deploying caused by mixing package managers, it was easier to copy the files to a new repo for deployment.

To set up this project on your machine, first install yarn or npm, react. Clone repo, cd to dir ./src run yarn yarn start.

My live version is here [MemeMaker](https://tannerpace.github.io/MemeMaker/).
